    <div>
        <p>By presenting my report in html, it is easier to produce and takes less time
        to present it to a wider audience.</p>
        <br />
        <p>The document 'planets', gives the reader an extensive view of the solar System,
        to make the report easier for the reader, I have included a 'Table of Contents' at 
        the beginning of the report, where the reader can clearly see how the report is 
        made up, and gives the reader a link to specific areas of the report, which they
        may need to access as a priority.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Also there is a 'List of figures', which catergorise the pictures included within
        the report, giving the picture a name, and highlights the page number within the report
        where the reader can find the picture.</p>
        <br />
        <p>At the end of the report,there is an 'Index', again showing the reader where they
        can fnd different elements of the report.</p>
        <br />
        <p>By posting the report online, the reader can access from where they are, on a computer,
        tablet or smart phone as long as they have the URL and an internet connection.they can
        download and save to their personel files for future reference.</p>
