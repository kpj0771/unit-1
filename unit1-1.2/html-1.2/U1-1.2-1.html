                    html page, CSS page}, so I can use the template as a design, enabling myself
                    to quickly form documents that are pre-formatted, and I can adapt individually

                I would be able to use tools that are included in software programs such as
                <b>[Word/ Excel]</b>, these tools would make the reader’s experience easier to access
                the document and get a clear understanding.

                    of the document, including title of a chapter, subtitle of different elements of
                    that chapter. Provides page numbers and a link to these titles and subtitles
                    for easy access].

    To learn the skills needed to successfully use these tools, I would have to research the
    internet for tutorials regarding the tool subject, there are free tutorials on the YouTube
    website, other payable websites with more extensive tutorials, such as [Pluralsight, Udemy,
    FreeCodeCamp, capita Bootcamp etc].
